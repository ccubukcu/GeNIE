main.label.aboutPortal          = GeNIE is a software solution for providing the basic functionality required to apply gamification to a course using points, leaderboards, badges, and achievements.
main.label.body                 = Once again, I greatly appreciate you takign your time to actually check the site out before filling out the survey. There's a lot of appreciation right there. If you are reading this and thinking to yourself, what now? Let me give some guidance on what can be done and you can decide what to do.\n<br /><br />\nStudents have it easy, there isn't much to do really. You can see current courses, enroll and unenroll in courses through course list page. You can go to course pages from course list and my courses pages. From the course details page you can do a couple things including viewing your grades and gamification stuff.\n<br /><br />\nInstructors, on the other hand can do quite many things. They can create courses, assign these courses to semesters. Then create course plans for these semester courses as well as adding assignments and course materials through the course plans page. They can grade and enter attendance information for students. The most relevant part to this thesis can be found in the gamification page. Here you can create achievements, badges and manipulate settings of gamification for each semester course.\n<br /><br />\nAll you need to do to get started is click the login button on the top right corner. You can find all the related links on that menu once you login.\n<br /><br />\nWell, that was the crash course, have fun!
